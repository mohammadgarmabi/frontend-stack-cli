# Frontend Stack Setup CLI

This is a command line interface (CLI) tool for setting up a new frontend project stack. It provides a guided process for creating a new project, selecting the project starter, additional features, project architecture, and tools.

## Getting Started

To use this tool, you can simply run:

```bash
npx frontend-stack-cli
```

The CLI will then prompt you with a series of questions. Based on your answers, it will automatically configure your project with the appropriate structure, tools, and features.

## Project Structure

The project structure can be set up in two different ways: **Feature Folder** and **Atomic Design**.
- **Feature Folder:** Organizes the project by features.
- **Atomic Design:** Organizes the project by design components.

## Tools

The CLI also allows you to select and install various tools for your project, including:
- **Testing Tools** (e.g., Jest, Playwright, Storybook)
- **Data Fetching Tools** (e.g., axios, React Query, SWR)
- **Form Management Tools** (e.g., react-hook-form, Formik)
- **State Management Tools** (e.g., Redux, Zustand)
- **UI Frameworks** (e.g., MUI, Tailwind)
- **Routing Tools** (e.g., React Router)

## Features

The CLI allows you to select and install various features for your project:
- **ESLint**

- And more…
